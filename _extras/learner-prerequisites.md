## Pre-Workshop Survey

For a motivation of this survey type, see Greg Wilson's template in 
[Teaching Tech Together](
https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:checklists-preassess).

### Shell

#### Moving Things

You are provided with a directory of 300 files that end with `.log`, `.data` 
and `.err` at equal proportions. You want to rename all `.log` files to `.out` 
files. How do you do this?

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Moving around

You are on `/bigdata/users/wolfman/projects/study` and want to jump over to
`/bigdata/projects/experiments/at-moonlight` on the command line.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Collaborator Candy

A collaborator provides you an implementation of a state-of-the-art simulation
that you need to compare your own predictions to. He tells you: "You can use it
on the command line right away. Unpack the file I sent you and use the `sim`
executable in the `bin/` folder from it. The rest is explained in the output of
the `--help` flag." 

You want to use this new program on your cluster, starting with reading the
"help" message from the `sim` executable.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Automating All The Things

You notice that you've been copying & pasting the same sequence of 5 shell
commands more than a few times during the day. It occurs to you that capturing
the workflow in a shell script would simplify the task and make it more
repeatable. The script would take two arguments, i.e. the file to read data
from and a new filename to write the processed results into.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.


## Python

#### Lists 1

You are provided with a Python list of integer values. The list has length 1024
and you would like to obtain all entries from index 50 to 101.

1. I can do that. Give me a Python interpreter and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Lists 2

You are provided a list of 512 random float values. These values range between
0 and 100. You would like to remove any entry in this list that is larger than
90 or smaller than 10.

1. I can do that. Give me a Python interpreter and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Python Setup 1

Your operating system does not have Python installed. You would like to install
Python as well as the mpi4py library.

1. I can do that. Give me a Python interpreter and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Python Setup 2

Your operating system ships with Python 2.5 which is required for some of its
functionalities. Your job requires Python 3.8 which you have installed
already. Now you also need to install Numpy for Python 3.8 in a way so that it
does not affect the system's Python 2.5.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Numpy

You are provided two `np.ndarray` objects with shape `(32,16)` each. The
objects are called `x` and `y`. You would like to element-wise compute
`x[i] * y[i] + 42`.

1. I can do that. Give me a Python interpreter and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Modularization 1

You observe yourself copy-and-pasting 5 lines of your code over and over
again. You decide the put these lines into a function. For this, the function
requires 3 input parameters. The parameters are a file location, a specific
object hash (i.e. a string) and a parameter that controls the verbosity of the
function. The latter parameter has the default value "False".

1. I can do that. Give me a Python interpreter and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.


### Parallelisation

#### Common Choices

A compute task on your laptop takes 2 hours to complete. You fed 150 input
files to a single application that was started on the command line. You mention
this issue in the weekly group meeting. A team member mentions that similar
issues were resolved in the past by using a powerful workstation of your room
mate, a compute server of the institute located in the cellar, by using the
university data center or by purchasing cloud server infrastructure. Which one
do you choose most likely?

1. Your room mate's powerful desktop computer.
2. A computer workstation owned by your department.
3. The university data center.
4. Using a cloud computing service.

#### Jobs, Jobs, Jobs

A compute task on your laptop takes more than 2 hours to complete &mdash; you kill
the task and reconsider your approach. You feed 50 input files to a single
application that needs to run once for every input file. You conclude that this
is a good task for your cluster. You sit down and submit several jobs to the
cluster. Each job is limited to 10 minutes of the walltime. Each job defines an
output file of the structure `done_${FILENAME}.log` where `${FILENAME}` refers
to the location of your input file.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell on a cluster and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.

#### Multi-Parallel on one machine

One of the go-to tools of your domain has just been released on GitHub with a
version that can employ multiple cores on a single computer. You want to put
this software to use on your cluster. For this, you submit a job that requires
32 cores on one machine and 64 GB of RAM if available.

1. I can do that. Give me a shell on a cluster and I'll show you.
2. I'd need to look up the syntax in a cheatsheet or some old code and I'm good
   to do this.
3. I am unclear about this, I'd have to consult a colleague or a search engine
   to do this.
4. I am not sure what to do.
